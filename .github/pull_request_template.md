- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cognitedata/power-ops-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) updated
- [ ] Version bumped in [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/cognitedata/power-ops-sdk/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [_version.py](https://github.com/cognitedata/power-ops-sdk/blob/main/cognite/powerops/_version.py) per [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
