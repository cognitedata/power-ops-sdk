# Resync FDM

Resource Sync, `resync`, used to sync configuration files with CDF through the CLI tool `powerops`. Resync will generate a
set of toolkit files which can then be used to run toolkit for detailed diff before deploying changes. As toolkit doesn't
know what resources should be deleted to clean up changes we've implemented `resync purge` which deletes nodes and edges not
defined in the toolkit folder.

**NOTE:** The current implementation does not support calculating the `connection_losses` so a value must be provided if the
bid generation method requires it.

**NOTE:** The current implementation requires that "from_type/to_type" is provided in order to find the generator connections to
plants.

**WARNING:** All generators/plants must be listed in the configuration in order to be processed by resync. A configuration to include
all assets in a model file is in the backlog to be implemented.

## Configuration

### Configuration files

1. resync configuration
   - Contains all general configuration regarding resync
   - Refer to `power-ops-sdk/resync/configuration.yaml` as an example
2. data model configuration [Optional]
   - Contains data type specific configurations
   - One per subfolder in order to have different configurations per subfolder
   - Refer to `power-ops-sdk/resync/fornebu/data_model_configuration.yaml` as an example
3. data model population
   - Contains configuration of specific instances
   - Refer to type examples in `power-ops-sdk/resync/fornebu`, `power-ops-sdk/resync/stavanger` and `power-ops-sdk/resync/shared` as an example
   - Current recommendation is to only use resync for the below types but these can be expanded with further testing
     - market_configuration
     - price_area_information
     - bid_configuration_day_ahead
     - water_value_based_partial_bid_configuration
     - shop_based_partial_bid_configuration
     - generator
     - plant_information
     - shop_attribute_mapping
     - shop_commands
     - shop_model
     - shop_scenario
     - shop_scenario_set

### Default folder structure

â””â”€ configuration.yaml
```

**WARNING:** All data model files need to be located in subfolders from the root folder that is specified inside
the `configuration.yaml` in the `working_directory` field.

### Data Model Configuration

The below example configuration will populate every `production_min` property of objects with the type `generator`
by using the data from the `source_file` and navigating to the value in the dictionary that corresponds to the
`extraction_path`.

Any string keys contained inside `[]` will be substituted by that instance's field by that name, ie. the below
example would use the path `model.generator.Holen_G1.p_min` in order to populate the generator with name *Holen_G1*.

Any integer keys contained inside `[]` will fetch the value at that index, ie. like for example this
`extraction_path: "model.plant.[name].main_loss.[0]"` would get the 0 indexed item inside *main_loss*.

The `default_value` will be used for any instances that do not have any values in the designated `extraction_path`

```yaml
generator:
  production_min:
    source_file: "toolkit/modules/power_ops_template/files/[SOURCE-FILE]"
    extraction_path: "model.generator.[name].p_min"
    is_list: False
    default_value: 0.0
    cast_type: float
```

A general configuration for all instances of a specific type can be defined as above in the "data model configuration"
file but to override a configuration on a specific instance you can use the below syntax in the "data model population"
files.

Below is an instance of a plant in the `plant_information.yaml` and the *production_min* property is being
overridden by a custom `extraction_path`. This option currently only supports providing a `source_file` and the
`extraction_path` in the following syntax

`"[SOURCE:<source_file>]<extraction_path>"`

```yaml
- name: Lund
  display_name: Lund
  ordering: 1
  asset_type: plant
  production_min: "[SOURCE:files/model.yaml]model.plant.Lund.p_min"
```

**NOTE:** It is recommended to keep your source files in a toolkit module managing CDF files as this will also ensure the
source file gets uploaded to CDF and changes to the file managed by toolkit.

### References

Since there are many fields that references other fields or existing CDF resources you can use their external_id or
name to reference them using the below syntax.

When using `[external_id]` as the prefix like in *market_configuration* below then the following string must be an
exact match to an external_id. This can refer to any type in CDF as long as the full external_id is provided.

When using `[name]` as the prefix like in *price_area* below then the following string must be an exact match to the
name of an instance of the expected type for that field as the expected external_id will be extrapolated from the
inferred type and name. For example, the expected type is price_area so the generated external_id would be
`price_area_no2`

When using `[name|type:DataModelType]` as the prefix like the *partials* below, then it will handle in the same way as
for `[name]` except instead of inferring the type it will use the provided type in order to generate the external_id.
For example, the two *partials* external_ids would become `water_value_based_partial_bid_configuration_plant_lund` and
`shop_based_partial_bid_configuration_plant_lund_set_a`

```yaml
- name: Mixed Configuration
  market_configuration: "[external_id]market_configuration_nord_pool_day_ahead"
  price_area: "[name]NO2"
  bid_date_specification: '[["shift", {"days": -400}], ["floor", "day"]]'
  partials:
    - "[name|type:WaterValueBasedPartialBidConfiguration]Plant Lund"
    - "[name|type:ShopBasedPartialBidConfigurationWrite]Plant Lund Set A"
```

## Usage

Instructions assume Cognite client is configured through `power_ops_config.yaml` and resync configuration is located at
`resync/configuration.yaml`.

See available commands:

```bash
powerops --help
```

Step 1: Example of generating toolkit files:

```bash
powerops pre-build power_ops_config.yaml resync/configuration.yaml
```

Step 2: Example of dry run purging (deleting) nodes/edges not in the generated toolkit files:

```bash
powerops purge power_ops_config.yaml resync/configuration.yaml --dry-run
```

Step 3: Build and deploy toolkit module, see toolkit documentation for details here.

Step 4: Example of purging nodes/edges not in the generated toolkit files when satisfied with dry-run output:

```bash
powerops purge power_ops_config.yaml resync/configuration.yaml
```

## Migration Guide to 15 min Market

With the change in the market from 1 hour to 15 min granularity bids the only changes needed by customers in the PowerOps solution is to update their configurations in resync.

In preparation for the transition in the market out advice would be to duplicate your existing bid configurations and have two sets of configurations, one for 1 hour and the other for 15 min (with the 1 hour configurations being deleted once the transition is completed and verified). You can reference our example bid configurations in the `power-ops-sdk/resync/` folder where we have duplicated all our bids and prefixed everything related to the 15 min bids "15 min", see [resync/shared/bid_configuration_day_ahead.yaml](resync/shared/bid_configuration_day_ahead.yaml).

There are a few specific objects that need to be updated for this change, detailed below.

### Market Configuration

The `time_unit` field on the Market Configuration must be updated to "15m". This is used to display in the proper format in the frontend and for parts of the bid generation logic to validate we have the right number of columns (ie. 96 columns for 15 min and 24 for 1 hour).

```yaml
- name: "Nord Pool Day-Ahead 15 min"
  max_price: 4000.0
  min_price: -500.0
  timezone: "Europe/Oslo"
  price_unit: "EUR/MWh"
  price_steps: 200
  tick_size: 0.1
  time_unit: 15m
  trade_lot: 0.1
```

### Shop Time Resolution

The `time_resolution_minutes` must be 15 during the time period where SHOP needs to produce 15 min granularity. See Sintef's documentation about how to use `time.timeresolution` but the below configuration in Resync would result in the following SHOP configuration.

```yaml
- name: 15 min test
  minutes_after_start:
    - 0
    - 1440 # 1 day
    - 4320 # 3 days
  time_resolution_minutes:
    - 15
    - 60
    - 240 # 4 hours
```

Resulting SHOP Time Configuration where the resolution is 15 for the first day which will be used for the bid generation. The period that will be used for bid generation must be 15 in order to get the correct number of columns from the ShopResult in post-processing.

```yaml
time:
  endtime: '2025-08-17 22:00:00'
  starttime: '2025-08-07 22:00:00'
  timeresolution:
    '2025-08-07 22:00:00': 15
    '2025-08-08 22:00:00': 60
    '2025-08-10 22:00:00': 240
```

### Shop Scenario

Ensure the `time_resolution` reference points to the correct ShopTimeResolution instance.

**Note:** If you are making duplicates of your bid configurations to have both 1 hour and 15 min you'll need to duplicate your ShopScenarios and ShopScenarioSets as well in order to update all the proper references.

```yaml
- name: "15 min Fornebu base"
  model: "[name]Fornebu"
  commands: "[name]default"
  time_resolution: "[name|type:ShopTimeResolution]15 min test"
  source: resync
  attribute_mappings_override: []
  output_definition:
    - "[name]market price"
    - "[name]plant production"
    - "[name]plant consumption"
```
